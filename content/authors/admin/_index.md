Cognition: I investigate how areas across the brain work together to produce cognition.

Anatomy: I study how subtle changes to anatomy across brain areas can lead to the sudden emergence of new function, or dysfunction.

Neural networks: I develop brain-inspired neural network models, to link from neural circuit interactions to dynamical patterns of activity across the cortex and behavior.
