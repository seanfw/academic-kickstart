abstract: "We discovered that people who had brain injury associated with very preterm birth has reduced dopamine function and smaller hippocampus than controls. The dopamine dysfunction was associated with negative and cognitive psychiatric symptoms. This work identifies a possible mechanism underlying mental illness following early brain injury, and suggests a potential drug target for treating such symptoms."
